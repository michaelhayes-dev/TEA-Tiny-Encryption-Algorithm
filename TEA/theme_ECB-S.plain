The common theme in all of these ciphertexts is death or the grave.
Specificially, the ciphertexts deal with females who have died.

Ciphertext 1: Dead Babe
Ciphertext 2: Annabelle Lee in her tomb by the sea
Ciphertext 3: The faithful love buried in the silent tomb
Ciphertext 4: The blacksmith's mother who lies in the grave

Honestly, I don't know what this class is dealing with,
But I've noticed quite a bit of morbid untertones throughout the class.
HW1 had a problem whose answer was "You Are Terminated"
HW1 also had a problem that was in support of Communism
And now we have a whole project about death...
Can you explain why this is? I find this very unsettling for a Cedarville class..
Thanks.
